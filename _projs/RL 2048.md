In this work I implemented Deep Q-network (DQN) to play the game 2048 using Keras. Different to a normal DQN, for getting the Q Values I used, the next 4 possible states(left, right, up, down) in addition to current state. This intuition was inspired from **Monte Carlo Tree Search** estimation where game is played till the end to determine the Q-Values.
